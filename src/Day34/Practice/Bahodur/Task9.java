    /*Task 9
          Given a HashMap<String, String>.
          The map has keys and values as follow:
          {"spinach": "dirt", "ice cream": "cherry"}

          Create a method with HashMap<String, String> parameter, return same type of map.
          The method should modify the map as follow:

          if the key is "ice cream", create a new key as "yogurt" and value should be the same as for "ice cream".
          If the key is "spinach", change that value to "nuts".

          Example:
          {"spinach": "dirt", "ice cream": "cherry"}

          Result:
          {"yogurt": "cherry", "spinach": "nuts", "ice cream": "cherry"}*/
}
